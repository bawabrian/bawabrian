# Hey, I'm Brian. 👋🏾

I work with data and numbers for a living. My background is in finance, which means I came to data analysis through the back door — years of making sense of messy spreadsheets, writing reports that people actually had to act on, and figuring out how to tell a clean story from a complicated dataset.

These days I spend a lot of time in SQL, Excel, and Power BI. Not because the tools are the point, but because they tend to get me to the answer faster.

I am also someone who speaks four languages, plays the guitar badly, cooks well, and reads more than is probably necessary. I mention this because I find that the curiosity tends to carry over.

If you want to see the work, it is right below. Each repo is a focused piece of analysis on a real dataset. Feel free to look around.
