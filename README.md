# Hey, I'm Brian. 👋🏾

I work with data and numbers for a living. My background is in finance, which means I came to data analysis through the back door — years of making sense of messy spreadsheets, writing reports that people actually had to act on, and figuring out how to tell a clean story from a complicated dataset.

These days I spend a lot of time in SQL, Excel, and Power BI. Not because the tools are the point, but because they tend to get me to the answer faster.

When I'm not wrangling data, you'll find me playing the guitar, experimenting in the kitchen, out cycling, or deep in a book. Big believer that the best professionals are curious people first. I also love languages

If you want to see the work, it is right below. Each repo is a focused piece of analysis on a real dataset. Feel free to look around.
